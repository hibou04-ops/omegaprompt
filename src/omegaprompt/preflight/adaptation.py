"""AdaptationPlan - the shared contract between preflight and pipeline.

The plan carries parameter overrides that the main calibration consumes
before starting. Each override is derived deterministically from the
preflight measurements and analytical findings; the adaptation layer
never *weakens* the discipline (it may only raise thresholds, reduce
search budget, or narrow rubric weights).

Invariant (enforced by :func:`derive_adaptation_plan`):

- ``min_kc4_override`` is never lower than the caller-supplied default.
- ``max_gap_override`` is never higher than the caller-supplied default.
- ``rubric_weight_overrides`` only zero out dimensions; they do not
  reweight upward.
- ``schema_mode_fallback`` only moves STRICT_SCHEMA -> JSON_OBJECT, never
  the other direction.
- ``unlock_k_override`` is never larger than the caller-supplied default.
