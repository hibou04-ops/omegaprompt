"""Judge Protocol - provider-neutral scoring contract.

Every judge consumes (rubric, dataset_item, target_response) and returns
a ``JudgeOutcome`` carrying the result, usage, optional degradation
events, and latency. No judge implementation may import a provider SDK
directly — they go through :class:`LLMProvider` if they need an LLM call.

Reviewer P0: judge provider degradation events were dropped on the floor
between LLMJudge and PromptTarget. ``JudgeOutcome`` carries them
forward. It iterates as ``(result, usage)`` so existing tuple-unpacking
callers keep working unchanged.
