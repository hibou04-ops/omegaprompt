"""Provider-neutral meta-axes.

Each enum captures a semantic dimension of prompt configuration that every
major LLM provider exposes in some form, without tying the public contract
to any single vendor's parameter names. Adapters translate these to
vendor-native params in their ``call()`` implementation.

Design rule: enum members are ordered from cheapest/lightest to
strongest/most-expensive. A searcher can treat the ordinal as a proxy for
cost/capability axis and probe from both ends to cut the space quickly.
